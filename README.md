# cse_dse_challenge
The objective of this competition is to introduce Data Science process pipeline with some hands-on experience. The data set used for this competition was collected from the side of the road while vehicles were passing on the road. multiple readings captured from a few sensors are given to you. The objective of the task is to be able to identify the presence [1] or absence [0] of a vehicle on the road based on the sensor readings using Data Science. For you to build a system that can identify the presence of a vehicle on the road we are giving you 2500 data points with the labels 1 to indicate the presence and 0 to indicate the absence of a vehicle.
